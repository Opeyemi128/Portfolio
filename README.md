## My Portfolio Website

    My portfolio website was developed to showcase my skills, experience and project works.

### Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a portfolio site using Docker and automate the deployment process with GitHub Actions. The application is containerized using Docker and deployed to Google Cloud Run.

### How the Dockerfile was built

- Base Image: I used a light web server image, nginx:alpine, to serve the static files for the portfolio site.

- Building the Image: The command docker build -t portfolio-site . packages the siteâ€™s files into a Docker image.

- Running the Container: The command docker run -p 8080:80 portfolio-site starts the container and makes the site available at localhost:8080.

### GitHub Actions Workflow Steps

The workflow automatically builds and deploys the portfolio site to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.
